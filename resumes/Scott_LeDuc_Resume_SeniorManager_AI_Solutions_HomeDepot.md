## WHY HOME DEPOT

Home Depot's transformation to agentic AI for retail experiences aligns directly with my recent work building production multi-agent systems. The combination of my hands-on technical depth in AI/ML, proven program management (PMO recognition), and track record of translating strategy into measurable execution makes me well-positioned to deliver immediate impact on your AI Solutions team.

I'm particularly excited about applying agentic AI to retail challenges — personalization at scale, customer journey optimization, and intelligent associate tools are problems where my ML and cloud architecture experience directly applies.
